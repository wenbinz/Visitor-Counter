in Index.php, it calls on the first python script (read.py) to
read the number from counter.txt and display on the screen along 
with text "Total visitors:". It then calls the second python script
(update.py) to increment the value in  counter.txt by one. 

The rest of the script is for the second part in which I set a cookie to 
each viewer's web browser for a duration of one day. The script first check
to see if such cookie called "LastVisit" exists on the visitor's hisotry.
If not, it welcomes the user to the site. if the cookie is found the it 
echos a welcome back message along with the last visited time.
